How to run locally
==================
1) Put your photo in the "images" folder and name it: my-photo.jpg  (JPG or PNG is fine).
   - If you prefer a different name, edit index.html and change the <img src="images/my-photo.jpg"> path.
2) Open index.html in your browser (double-click) or use VS Code's Live Server for the best experience.
3) Update your LinkedIn and GitHub links in index.html (search for href="#" and replace with your URLs).
4) Optional: If fonts look different, you can add Google Fonts links for "Inter" and "Playfair Display" in <head>.

Troubleshooting
---------------
• If the image doesn't appear: ensure the file is indeed in images/ and named exactly my-photo.jpg (case-sensitive).
• If you see old content, refresh with Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R to clear cache.
